# Pediatric-Clinic


Often the medical problems of children are always the greatest concern for parents, so they turn 
to pediatricians for better medical and health care and follow-up for their children and the extent 
of their health development. Therefore, clinics are crowded with children, which causes 
irregularity in the medical process. Therefore, clinics and medical hospitals resort to managing 
and organizing patientsâ€™ files for children to organize appointments for statements, operations, 
and bills for health care services, operations, medicines, and medical supplies. In addition, most 
of the existing medical programs do not meet the needs of the pediatrician, and dealing with 
them is difficult and complex, and does not allow the management of large medical clinics. So, 
the children's clinic program can make it easier for us to search for the child's name to know all 
his data, and to book exam dates from him, and the program facilitates many things.
